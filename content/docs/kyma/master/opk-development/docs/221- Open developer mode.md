## background
In order to ensure the safety of the machine system, USB debugging (plug in adb) is disabled by default in future versions. The machine and corresponding versions are as follows:
* Greetbot: V6.9 and later versions
* Mini: V6.13 and later versions

## Open method
ADB is closed by default in the factory version, and can only be temporarily turned on by the following methods:

1. At any time (including self-check abnormality), one-finger pull down >> click the time zone multiple times in a row.

   </video>

2. The dynamic password input page pops up, which displays the system date and timeï¼Œand enter your dynamic password. Obtain the dynamic password, view the 'Query dynamic password' section.

3. When "Enable debugging" is turned on, the second menu "Persistent debugging" is displayed.
    * The "Persistent debugging" menu is not displayed by default, and will only be displayed after "Enable debugging" is turned on.
    * After "Persistent debugging" is displayed, it is not turned on by default and needs to be turned on manually.
    * When the "Enable debugging" switch is turned off again, the "Persistent debugging" is automatically set to disabled and the menu is hidden.
