## Introduction
The robot system has been continuously iteratively upgraded, and with each upgrade, it has been continuously opening up more interfaces for customers to use. The ensuing problem is that when the application developed by the customer runs on a lower version, it may not run normally due to the lack of interfaces. In order to ensure the normal operation of the robot application, when installing through the application store, the compatibility judgment will be made according to the orionos-eve-core version of the current application. If it is not compatible, the installation is prohibited. When developing, you need to pay attention to the system version of the target machine. The applicable orionos-eve-core version can be selected according to the system version.

## Version Compatibility
Listed in the table is the minimum version of each robot model that can be compatible:

<div class="fixed-table bordered-table">

|core version|Greetbot|Mini|Lucki|Baodaping|
|:----------:|:------:|:---|:---:|:-----------:|
|2.3.0|6.1|5.13|5.7|5.4|
|2.2.0|5.13|5.13|5.7|5.4|

</div>

## Start method:
1. Command line to switch to the current project directory: 
    ```
    orionos-sh run
    ```
2. Three-finger slide from top of robot screen -> Application Center -> Xiaobao
3. Use this voice command to open sample OPK: 
    ```
    "Open the developer demo"
    ```
