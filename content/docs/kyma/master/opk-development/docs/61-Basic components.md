The following native components have been loaded by the robot and can be installed correctly when `orionos-sh` executes the command. 

When installing manually in `package.json`, please fill in the correct version number, otherwise the robot may not work normally.

Tips: 

1. When using these react-native components, please note that the version numbers need to be matched. If an incorrect version is installed using npm install, the component may become unusable. Please remove the corresponding components from package.json and reinstall the correct version.

2. If the IDE reports "Unable to find the declaration file of module'XXX' error" when using the module, don't pay too much attention. If you really don't want to see the wavy line, you can declare this module in the code to solve the problem. The solution can be searched on Google: ReactNative cannot find the declaration file error of the module 'xxx'.
